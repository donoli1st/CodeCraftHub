This project structure is designed for a User Management Service using Node.js and MongoDB. It follows best practices for scalability, maintainability, and security. Each folder has a specific purpose:

src/: Contains the source code for the service.

config/: Holds configuration files for database and server settings.
controllers/: Contains controller files that handle incoming requests.
models/: Contains Mongoose models that define the user schema.
routes/: Defines the API routes for user management.
middleware/: Contains middleware functions for authentication and authorization.
services/: Contains business logic related to user management.
utils/: Includes utility functions, such as logging.
validations/: Contains validation logic for incoming user data.
app.js: Main application file to set up middleware and routes.
index.js: Entry point that starts the server.
tests/: Contains unit and integration tests for the user management functionality.

.env: Stores environment variables for sensitive information like database connection strings.

.gitignore: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by git.

package.json: Lists project dependencies and scripts for running the application.

README.md: Provides documentation for the project.
